# TANAFS – Ventilator Waveform Anomaly Detection


##  Introduction
This project addresses the challenge of manually monitoring and interpreting ventilator waveforms, 
a process that is mentally demanding, and heavily reliant on the experience of medical staff. So we propose the development 
of an intelligent automated detection system that analyzes ventilator waveform images. To overcome the critical challenges in manual ventilator waveform monitoring.
