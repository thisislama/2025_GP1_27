# TANAFS – Ventilator Waveform Anomaly Detection


##  Introduction
This project addresses the challenge of manually monitoring and interpreting ventilator waveforms, 
a process that is mentally demanding, and heavily reliant on the experience of medical staff. So we propose the development 
of an intelligent automated detection system that analyzes ventilator waveform images. To overcome the critical challenges in manual ventilator waveform monitoring.

##  Technology
 #### All software tools/technology will be used for this project:
Python: main programming language, 
Django: web framework for Python, 
HTML, CSS and JavaScript: front-end technologies, 
MySQL: database system, 
TensorFlow / PyTorch: AI/ML libraries for model development,  
OpenCV: image processing library, 
FPDF / ReportLab: for PDF generation, 
Google Colab: IDE for AI model training, 
Visual Studio Code: IDE for web development, 
PythonAnywhere: Cloud hosting platform for deploying the website.


##  Launching Instructions
The system will be hosted in pythonsnyqehre it will be open source website, But for now the project is still under development but you can preview it locally by
